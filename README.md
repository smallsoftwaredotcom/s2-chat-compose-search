# S2 Chat Compose User Picker

This module is intended to be used as a submodule dependency within another repository.

## How To Use

This typescript project is compiled and built automatically when committing code (using husky). Once the repo is added as a submodule inside another project, files within the `/build` folder can be imported for use.

## Development

It is recommended that you make changes within this repository, rather than when working inside another project. Check out this repo from GitHub, and develop locally. Once you're complete, run `yarn build` and open a PR.
